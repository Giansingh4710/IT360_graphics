Universal Power Law (UPLGPI)
  1) Predict how pedestrians move in a crowd
  2) Yes. It can be used in video games and and engineering planning
  3) Simulating Pedestrians' Street smarts
  4) How realistic is the simulation
  5) Simulation is Good but weaknesses: Homogeneity, individual actions, mental and culture aspects
  6) More realistic simulation

Rendering Synthetic Objects into 
  1) Put synthetic objects into real pictures
  2) Yes. Can be used in film, video games, home decoration. Gives accesibility to people to add fake objects that don't know editing
  3) Allow users to insert objects within an image
  4) How realistic is the image looks
  5) Strength: Can insert objects and look realistc. Better than Retinex Weak: No mesh insertion and lighting is weak. Bad if bad image quality and bad annotation.
  6) better illumination formulas and mesh insertion. Better water/mirror reflection
