The simulation allows agents to cross the boundaries of the canvas, which
results in abrupt teleportation of agents to the opposite side.

The agents in the simulation exhibit avoidance behavior, but there's a missing
aspect of social interaction. They only seem to avoid each other without any
clear goal or collective behavior. Real-world crowd simulations often involve
interactions beyond mere avoidance, such as flocking or group formation.

The agents' velocities are directly adjusted by the
avoidance forces, leading to sudden and unrealistic changes in direction. Real
individuals tend to exhibit smoother, continuous motion with gradual adjustments
in response to their surroundings.

They Overlap so collions don't work well
The dot slow down very weirdly
Some dots repel each other too much
Feels like magnatic force
