2) In the current simulation, agents abruptly teleport when crossing canvas
boundaries, lacking continuity. While agents exhibit avoidance behavior, they
lack more nuanced social interactions seen in real-world crowds, such as
flocking or group formation. Furthermore, the agents' velocities are directly
impacted by avoidance forces, resulting in sudden and unrealistic directional
changes, unlike the smoother and gradual adjustments seen in real human motion.

They Overlap so collions don't work well
The dot slow down very weirdly
Some dots repel each other too much
Feels like magnatic force

4) Simulating a large crowd of agents is challenging due to the need for high FPS,
fast algorithms, and realistic visualization. Maintaining good FPS can be
difficult as a large number of agents strain the system. Speedy algorithms are
essential for smooth agent interactions, and efficient visualization techniques
are required for realistic representation without overloading the graphics.
Balancing these factors is crucial for effective real-time crowd simulations.
