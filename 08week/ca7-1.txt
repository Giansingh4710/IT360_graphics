1) The cloth simulation exhibits a high degree of realism. Its movement is
smooth and natural, accurately mirroring how real cloth would bounce and sway.
The absence of choppy or abrupt motions adds to its authenticity. Furthermore,
the shadow rendering contributes significantly to the overall realism, enhancing
the perception of depth and materiality, making the simulation appear
exceptionally lifelike.

2) The compliance makes the cloth more bouncy and elastic. The lower the bar
the more it bounces
