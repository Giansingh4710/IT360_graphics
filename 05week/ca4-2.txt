Creating an ant walking animation using keyframing:
  First, I would start by defining the ant's skeleton or rig, with joints at its
  legs, body, and head. Next, I'd establish the key poses that represent the ant's
  walking cycle, typically including the starting pose, mid-walk pose, and ending
  pose. These key poses help define the overall movement of the ant. To achieve a
  smooth transition between these key poses, I'd set up interpolation techniques
  like Bezier curves for the joints' rotation angles, ensuring realistic and
  organic motion. Then, I'd fine-tune the animation curves, adjusting the timing
  and easing to add weight and subtlety to the ant's movements. Incorporating
  secondary animations like antennae wiggling and adjusting the body's position as
  it moves forward would enhance realism. Lastly, I'd consider the environment and
  lighting to integrate the ant seamlessly into the scene, applying principles of
  physics-based rendering to ensure the animation appears natural within its
  context.
