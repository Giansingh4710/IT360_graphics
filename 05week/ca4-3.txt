Motion capture system captures actor's movement using markers/sensors. Data is
processed to extract key points. Motion data is mapped onto ant model. Animation
is adjusted for natural movement. Ant model is rendered with effects for final
animation. Ant-specific challenges may limit feasibility.

   Creating an ant walking animation using motion capture involves several
  technical concepts. First, a motion capture system would be set up, consisting
  of multiple cameras or sensors to track the movement of an actor wearing markers
  or sensors on their body. The actor would perform the walking motion, and the
  motion capture system would record the positional data of the markers/sensors.
  This data would then be processed using software to extract the key points of
  the motion, such as the position and orientation of the limbs and body. Next,
  the motion data would be mapped onto a 3D model of an ant, aligning the
  corresponding joints and limbs. Additional adjustments may be made to ensure the
  animation looks natural and ant-like. Finally, the animated ant model would be
  rendered with textures, lighting, and other visual effects to create the final
  walking animation. However, it's worth noting that motion capture for ants
  specifically may not be feasible due to their small size and complex leg
  movements, which could be challenging to capture accurately.
