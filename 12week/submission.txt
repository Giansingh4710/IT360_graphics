  In one of the links, a stream like fluid is being simulated
  while in the other, a solid like fluid is being simulated.
  like the fluid has dots in it. Both are very different.
  1 seems like its simulating water being droped and is more fluid
  while the other is like a fluid stream that is more grid based

  This code creates a cool fluid simulation using a grid. It keeps track of stuff
  like how fast the fluid is moving (velocity), how much stuff is in it (density),
  and those twisty patterns (vorticity). The denser areas show up in bright red,
  and the vorticity does its thing in green and blue. You can play around by
  clicking the mouse to add more density and make the fluid move. The magic
  happens on a grid, and the code uses tricks like advection, diffusion, and
  vorticity confinement to make it look like a flowing liquid. It's like a digital
  lava lamp that you can control!

   The code presents three different visualization methods for the fluid
  simulation. The "marching" method outlines the boundaries of fluid regions using
  marching squares, resulting in a clear representation of fluid shapes but with a
  blocky appearance. The "smooth" method smoothens the visualization, providing a
  more continuous representation of the fluid boundary by interpolating between
  grid points. The "pixels" method uses squares to represent fluid regions,
  offering a straightforward pixelated visualization. Pros of the "marching"
  method include clarity of boundaries, while the "smooth" method offers a
  visually smoother representation. However, to enhance the fluid-like appearance,
  further improvements in interpolation and visual smoothness could be explored,
  and the addition of color gradients based on fluid properties might contribute
  to a more realistic fluid simulation. Additionally, incorporating more
  sophisticated fluid dynamics algorithms could improve the overall realism of the
  simulation.

   Changing the 'rez' parameter in the provided code affects the resolution of the
  fluid simulation. A higher 'rez' value leads to a finer grid, resulting in a
  more detailed and accurate representation of the fluid's behavior, but it also
  increases computational complexity. Conversely, a lower 'rez' value provides a
  coarser simulation, reducing computational demands but potentially sacrificing
  detail and accuracy in the visualization.
